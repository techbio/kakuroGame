# I Found e In Kakuro

## *No it is not the relation of #permutations = n!/e (or is it? the writer himself awaits a definitive resolution).*

So I found the mysterious e, Euler's Constant, while precomputing tables for a puzzle game (Kakuro) solver I am working on.

The relationship appeared as I was investigating the number of permutations of 9 or fewer digits, in a table: 986400

Dividing by some relevant factors, 9, 8, 7... then, 9!... and the result was an even 2.7183, Euler's constant approximated to four decimal places.
I felt there may be a shining, golden bounty for this discovery.

But I found on the fourth result from a query to Google, toward the bottom of this page,
a definition given for the "number of derangements of a set of n elements": [n!/e]
https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/probability-main-index/permutation-combination-formula/

It appears to my eyes at the present time that if the definition is correct, my table must be a list of derangements
and not simply permutations, as would match the name of the table ('perms').

This is entirely ordinary, if one has the references, or the time, the author discovers, to see a rhyme.
