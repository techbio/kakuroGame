for each integer in (1-9):
        create a new combination of the integer itself, length 1
        for each combination, create a new combination of length n+1 by appending the integer
        for each combination, create a new permutation from the combination
        for each permutation, create permutations of length n+1 by inserting the integer at each index 0-(length-1)
